I finally made a portfolio website

This Project was made using this template: https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/next-stitches-typescript

## TODO
* make non hoverable stickers
* Create middle glow
* instead of apple logo, an M logo
* Setup ESLint or prettier.
* Store laptop coordinates in the store?
* Remove the laptop animation in the beginning.
* absolutely positioned social buttons on the bottom.
* height of website only fits the viewport? Canvas is extending a little bit because of the header?
* create a pretty blurred background similar to https://zustand.surge.sh/
* create an intro animation?
* use react spring to animate the header
* after that make a parent component that iterates through it and
* backgrounds change based on what sticker you're hovering
* Play with webgl backgrounds
* Change the mouse icon
* Add particles
* Consider mobile layout
* Incorporate accessibility (https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-a11y)
* Have an actual reticle algorithm for the shape (https://pastebin.com/m8nRvASLeee)
